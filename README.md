# Admin Dashboard

[Live site](https://sheacronin.github.io/admin-dashboard).

This project is practice using CSS Grid Layout to recreate a given design (found in [this image here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png)). This was also an exercise in using nesting, mixins, and variables with SCSS.
